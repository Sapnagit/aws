What is cloud computing?

Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including 
servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the 
Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and 
economies of scale. 

You typically pay only for cloud services you use, 
helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more 
efficiently and scale as your business needs change.

Types of cloud computing ?

1. Public Cloud :

Public clouds are the most common way of deploying cloud computing. The cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the Internet.

With a public cloud, all hardware, software and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider.

In a public cloud, you share the same hardware, storage and network devices with other organisations or cloud “tenants.”

You access services and manage your account using a web browser. 

Public cloud deployments are frequently used to provide web-based email, online office applications, storage and testing and development environments.
